    <h1 class="video-header p-3 m-0">Motion Planning</h1>
    <p class="video-desc p-3 m-0">PRM with parameters configurable via variables inside PRM.cpp. Liam's camera was used.
	    Some difficulty I had when trying to program this was primarily getting the agents moving with boids.
	    The parameters were hard to tune without it bouncing back and forth. Other difficulty was finding that parentheses I missed when
	    checking for intersections. Another difficulty is OpenGL in general. I could have used processing, but I wanted to figure out
	    how OpenGL works because it's powerful. From my previous project, I came in with misunderstandings, so the draw function in PRM.cpp
	    keeps bufferring new vertices instead of reusing them.<br /><br />
	    0:03 - Single agent navigating<br />
	    0:24 - Agent interaction opposing paths<br />
	    0:34 - Agent interaction turn<br />
	    0:55 - Agent interaction more turns<br />
	    1:07 - 100 Agents<br />
	    1:56 - 100 Agents more turns<br />
	    2:45 - 3 agents<br />
	    3:16 - 1000 agents<br />
	    5:04 - odd behavior with forces pushing other agents and they get stuck because no replanning<br />
	    5:52 - 20 agents, some from above, some from bottom, top ones go straight to the goal<br />

	    All agents use the same path or the reverse path. More can be generated by creating another configuration object.<br />
	    Path smoothing is in all of it.<br />
	    Boids is used and can be seen in all of the scenarios.<br />
	    Extent of agents is 0.5m and is used, but not as a cylinder or circle. If it doesn't seem like it, divide radius on line 150 of agent.cpp by 2.f<br />
	    Problems with highly dense scenarios and tight paths, such as the two circles on the bottom.<br />
	    The following were implemented:
	  <ul>
		  <li>Boids</li>
		  <li>PRM with UCS</li>
		  <li>Took into account agent extents, which are 0.5m and can be configured. Seen by the gap between points</li>
		  <li>Multiple Obstacles</li>
		  <li>Scenarios with interesting agent interactions, along the same path, colliding, and gathering once stopped</li>
		  <li>Scenarios with interesting local minima</li>
		  <li>Scenario where simulation produces odd behavior: where highly dense and forces push agents away from path and they get stuck because they don't replan</li>
		  <li>Path smoothing</li>
		  <li>I think my program can do 3D navigation since it only uses spheres, but I never tested it out, so whatever</li>

    <p class="video-desc p-3 m-0">Shows an animated agent traversing a path found by UCS. Currently no collision checking or path highlighting due to time constraints. The path is printed in the output.<br />
	  Each milestone has 5 neighbors, which is a parameter that can be altered in the simulation within the configuration.cpp file.</p>
